- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid or unreachable domains gracefully.
- **Easy to Use**: Just list the domains and run the script.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## How to Use

### 2. Prepare the Script

   Open the downloaded script file `GRANDAlookup.py` in your text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This will allow you to make any necessary adjustments or modifications to the script.

### 3. Edit the Script (Optional)

   If you want to perform lookups on different domains, you can modify the list of websites in the script. Find the section in the script that defines the `websites` list and update it with your desired domains:

       'example.com',
       'google.com',
       'facebook.com'
   ]
